The project aims to address a significant gap in AI-powered Question and Answer (Q&A) systems by providing a solution that not only generates descriptive questions and answers but also offers a similarity score for user responses against the correct answers for descriptive questions. This innovative approach fills the identified research gap of lacking a mechanism for grading or scoring descriptive answers in existing Q&A generators. Furthermore, the system introduces detailed progress tracking, a feature not commonly available in the industry for descriptive Q&A, although the project team has decided not to label this aspect as a research gap due to the availability of progress tracking to some extent in the market. The primary goal is to enhance the academic learning experience by saving time in answer comparison, providing valuable insights, and instilling confidence, thereby contributing to improved long-term memory retention
